# causalQuartet
The average treatment effect can often be best understood in the context of its variation. <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/Causal_quartets.pdf">Causal quartets</a> depict the same average treatment effect under different patterns of heterogeneity. As with the famous correlation quartet of Anscombe (1973), causal quartets dramatize the way in which real-world variation can be more complex than simple numerical summaries.
